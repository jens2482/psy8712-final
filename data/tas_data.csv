How do their eyes work? Are they just like little flashlights that can help them look around or are their eyes just adjusting to the light in the darkness or is it just by itself? Their eyes just stay the same when they're born or do they adjust the more the more they get older, and does their vision get worse when they get older or does it stay the same since there like eyes are still in a small?",0,0,0,13,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,
